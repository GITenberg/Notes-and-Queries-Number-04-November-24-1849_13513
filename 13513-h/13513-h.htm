<h2>OUR PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS.</h2>
<p>When we consulted our literary friends as to the form and manner
in which it would be most expedient to put forth our "NOTES AND
QUERIES," more than one suggested to us that our paper should
appear only once a month, or at all events not more frequently than
once a fortnight, on the ground that a difficulty would be
experienced in procuring materials for more frequent publication.
We felt, however, that if such a medium of Inter-communication, as
we proposed to establish was, as we believed, really wanted,
frequency of publication was indispensable. Nothing but a weekly
publication would meet what we believed to be the requirements of
literary men. We determined, therefore, to publish a Number every
Saturday; and the result has so far justified our decision, that
the object of our now addressing our readers is to apologise to the
many friends whose communications we are again unavoidably
compelled to postpone; and to explain that we are preparing to
carry out such further improvements in our arrangements as will
enable us to find earlier admission for all the communications with
which we are favoured.</p>
<p>One other word. It has been suggested to us that in inviting
Notes, Comments, and Emendations upon the works of Macaulay,
Hallam, and other living authors, we may possibly run a risk of
offending those eminent men. We hope not. We are sure that this
outght not to be the case. Had we not recognised the merits of such
works, and the influence they were destined to exercise over men's
minds, we should not have opened our pages for the purpose of
receiving, much less have invited, corrections of the mistakes into
which the most honest and the most able of literary inquirers must
sometimes fall. Only those who have meddled in historical research
can be aware of the extreme difficulty, the all but impossibility,
of ascertaining the exact or the whole truth, amidst the numerous
minute and often apparently contradictory facts which present
themselves to the notice of all inquirers. In this very number a
correspondent comments upon an inference drawn by Mr. Hallam from a
passage in Mabillon. In inserting such a communication we show the
respect we feel for Mr. Hallam, and our <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span> sense of the
services which he has rendered to historical knowledge. Had we
believed that if he has fallen into a mistake in this instance, it
had been not merely a mistake, but a deliberate perversion of the
truth, we should have regarded both book and writer with
indifference, not to say with contempt. It is in the endeavour to
furnish corrections of little unavoidable slips in such good honest
books&mdash;albeit imperfect as all books must be&mdash;that we
hope at once to render good service to our national literature, and
to show our sense of genius, learning, and research which have
combined to enrich it by the production of works of such high
character and last influence.</p>
<hr />
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>LATIN EPIGRAM AGAINST LUTHER AND ERASMUS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;Your correspondent "Roterodamus" (pp. 27, 28)
asks, I hope, for the author of the epigram which he quotes, with a
view to a life of his great townsman, Erasmus. Such a book, written
by some competent hand, and in an enlarged and liberal spirit,
would be a noble addition to the literature of Europe. There is no
civilised country that does not feel an interest in the labours and
in the fame of Erasmus. I am able to answer your correspondents
question, but it is entirely by chance. I read the epigram which he
quotes several years ago, in a book of a kind which one would like
to see better known in this country&mdash;a typographical or
bibliographical history of Douay. It is entitled, "<i>Bibliographie
Douaisienne, ou Catalogue Historique et Raisonn&eacute; des Livres
imprim&eacute;s &agrave; Douai depuis l'ann&eacute;e 1563 jusqu'a
nos jours, avec des notes bibliographiques et litt&eacute;raires;
Par H.R. Duthilloeul. 8vo. Douai, 1842</i>." The 111th book noticed
in the volume is entitled, "<i>Epigrammata in H&aelig;reticos.
Authore Andrea Frusio, Societatis Jesu. Tres-petit in 8vo.
1596</i>." The book is stated to contain 251 epigrams, "aimed,"
says M. Duthilloeul, "at the heretics and their doctrines. The
author has but one design, which is to render odious and
ridiculous, the lives, persons, and errors of the apostles of the
Reformation." He quotes three of the epigrams, the third being the
one your correspondent has given you. It has this title, "<i>De
Lutheri et Erasmi differentia</i>," and is the 209th epigram in the
book.</p>
<p>I have never met with a copy of the work of Frusius, nor do I
know any thing of him as an author. The learned writer who pours
out a store of curious learning in the pages of <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> is more likely than any body that I know to tell you
something about him.</p>
<p>Mons. Duthilloeul quotes another epigram from the same book upon
the <i>Encomium Mori&aelig;</i>, but it is too long and too
pointless for your pages. He adds another thing which is more in
your way, namely, that a former possessor of the copy of the work
then before him had expressed his sense of the value of these
"epigrammes d&eacute;votes" in the following NOTE:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Nollem carere hoe libello auro nequidem contra
pensitato</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps some one who possesses or has access to the book would
give us a complete list of the persons who are the subjects of
these defamatory epigrams. And I may add, as you invite us to put
our queries, Is not Erasmus entitled to the distinction of being
regarded as the author of the work which the largest single edition
has ever been printed and sold? Mr. Hallam mentions that, "in the
single year 1527, Colin&aelig;us printed 24,000 copies of the
<i>Colloquies</i>, all of which were sold." This is the statement
of Moreri. Bayle gives some additional information. Quoting a
letter of Erasmus as his authority, he says, that Colin&aelig;us,
who&mdash;like the Brussels and American reprinters of our
day&mdash;was printing the book at Paris from a Basle edition,
entirely without the concurrence of Erasmus, and without any view
of his participation in the profit, circulated a report that the
book was about to be prohibited by the Holy See. The curiosity of
the public was excited. Every one longed to secure a copy. The
enormous edition&mdash;for the whole 24,000 was but one
impression&mdash;was published contemporaneously with the report.
It was a cheap and elegant book, and sold as fast as it could be
handed over the booksellers counter. As poor Erasmus had no
pecuniary benefit <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id=
"page51"></a>{51}</span> from the edition, he ought to have the
credit which arises from this proof of his extraordinary
popularity. The public, no doubt, enjoyed greatly his calm but
pungent exposure of the absurd practices which were rife around
them. That his humorous satire was felt by its objects, is obvious
from this epigram, as well as from a thousand other evidences.</p>
<p class="author">JOHN BRUCE.</p>
<hr />
<h3>HALLAMS MIDDLE AGES&mdash;ALLEGED IGNORANCE OF THE CLERGY.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;When reading Hallam's <i>History of the Middle
Ages</i> a short time ago I was startled by the following passage
which occurs amongst other evidences of the ignorance of the clergy
during the period subsequent to the dissolution of the Roman
Empire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Not one priest in a thousand in Spain about the age of
Charlemagne, could address a common letter of salutation to
another."&mdash;<i>Hallam's Middle Ages</i>, vol. iii. p. 332.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for this statement he refers to Mabillon, <i>De Re
Diplomatica</i>, p. 52.</p>
<p>On referring to Mabillon, I find that the passage runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Christiani posthabitis scripturis sanctis, earumque
interpretibus, Arabum Chald&aelig;orumque libris evolvendis
incumbentes, legem suam nesciebant, et linguam propriam non
advertebant latinam, ita ut ex omni Christi collegio vix
inveniretur unus in milleno hominum genere, qui salutatorias fratri
posset rationabiliter dirigere litteras."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that although Mabillon says that scarce one in a thousand
could address a <i>Latin</i> letter to another, yet he by no means
says that it was on account of their general ignorance, but because
they were addicting themselves to other branches of learning. They
were devoting all their energies to Arabic and Chald&aelig;an
science, and in their pursuit of it neglected other literature. A
similar remark might be made of respecting many distinguished
members of the University to which I belong; yet who would feel
himself justified in inferring thence that Cambridge was sunk in
ignorance?</p>

<h3>ADVERSARIA</h3>
<p class="note">[In our Prospectus we spoke of NOTES AND QUERIES
becoming everybody's common-place book. The following very friendly
letter from an unknown correspondent, G.J.K., urges us to carry out
such an arrangement.</p>
<p class="note">"Sir,&mdash;I beg leave to forward you a
contribution for your 'NOTES AND QUERIES,' a periodical which is, I
conceive, likely to do a vast deal of good by bringing literary men
of all shades of opinion into closer juxtaposition than they have
hitherto been.</p>
<p class="note">"I would, however, suggest that in future numbers a
space might be allotted for the reception of those articles (short
of course), which students and literary men in general, transfer to
their common-place books; such as notices of scarce or curious
books, biographical or historical curiosities, remarks on ancient
or obsolete customs, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Literary men are
constantly meeting with such in the course of their reading, and
how much better would it be if, instead of transferring them to a
MS. book to be seen only by themselves, or perhaps a friend or two,
they would forward them to a periodical, in which they might be
enshrined in imperishable pica; to say nothing of the benefits such
a course of proceeding would confer on those who might not have had
the same facilities of gaining the information thus made
public.</p>
<p class="note">"In pursuance of this suggestion, I have forwarded
the inclosed paper, and should be happy, from time to time, to
contribute such gleanings from old authors, &amp;c. as I might
think worth preserving.</p>
<p class="note">"G.J.K."</p>
<p class="note">We readily comply with G.J.K.'s suggestion, and
print, as the first of the series, his interesting communication,
entitled:]</p>
<p>1. <i>Writers of Notes on Fly-leaves, &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>The Barberini Library at Rome contains a vast number of books
covered with marginal notes by celebrated writers, such as
Scaliger, Allatius, Holstentius, David Haeschel, Barbadori, and
above all, Tasso, who has annotated with his own hand more than
fifty volumes. Valery, in his <i>Voyages en Italie</i>, states that
a Latin version of Plato is not only annotated by the hand of
Tasso, but also by his father, Bernardo; a fact which sufficiently
proves how deeply the language and philosophy of the Greek writers
were studied in the family. The remarks upon the <i>Divina
Commedia</i>, which, despite the opinion of Serassi, appear to be
authentic, attest the profound study which, from his youth, Tasso
had made of the great poets, and the lively admiration he displayed
for their works. There is also in existence a copy of the Venice
edition of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> (1477), with autograph notes
by Bembo.</p>
<p>Christina of Sweden had quite a mania for writing in her books.
In the library of the Roman College (at Rome) there are several
books annotated by her, amongst others a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> Quintus
Curtius, in which, as it would appear, she criticises very freely
the conduct of Alexander. "<i>He reasons falsely in this case</i>,"
she writes on one page; and elsewhere, "<i>I should have acted
diametrically opposite; I should have pardoned</i>;" and again,
further on, "<i>I should have exercised clemency</i>;" an
assertion, however, we may be permitted to doubt, when we consider
what sort of clemency was exercised towards Monaldeschi. Upon the
fly-leaf of a Seneca (Elzevir), she has written, "<i>Adversus
virtutem possunt calamitates damna et injuri&aelig; quod adversus
solem nebul&aelig; possunt</i>." The library of the Convent of the
Holy Cross of Jerusalem at Rome, possesses a copy of the
<i>Bibliotheca Hispanu</i>, in the first volume of which the same
princess has written on the subject of a book relating to her
conversion:<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> "<i>Chi l'ha scritta, non lo sa; chi
lo sa, non l'ha mai scritta</i>."</p>
<p>Lemontey has published some very curious <i>Memoirs</i>, which
had been entirely written on the fly-leaves and margins of a missal
by J. de Coligny, who died in 1686.</p>
<p>Racine, the French tragic poet, was also a great annotator of
his books; the Biblioth&egrave;que National at Paris possesses a
Euripides and Aristophanes from his library, the margins of which
are covered with notes in Greek, Latin, and French.</p>
<p>The books which formerly belonged to La Monnoie are now
recognizable by the anagram of his name. <i>A Delio nomen</i>, and
also by some very curious notes on the fly-leaves and margins
written in microscopic characters.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF WORD "GROG."</h3>
<p>Mr. Vaux writes as follows:&mdash;Admiral Vernon was the first
to require his men to drink their spirits mixed with water. In bad
weather he was in the habit of walking the deck in a rough
<i>grogram</i> cloak, and thence had obtained the nickname of
<i>Old Grog</i> in the Service. This is, I believe, the origin of
the name <i>grog</i>, applied originally to <i>rum</i> and
<i>water</i>. I find the same story repeated in a quaint little
book, called Pulleyn's <i>Etymological Compendium</i>.</p>
<p class="note">[A.S. has communicated a similar explanation; and
we are obliged to "An old LADY who reads for Pastime" for kindly
furnishing us with a reference to a newly published American work,
<i>Lifts for the Lazy</i>, where the origin of "Grog" is explained
in the same manner.</p>
<p class="note">The foregoing was already in type when we received
the following agreeable version of the same story.]</p>
<hr />
<h3>ORIGIN OF WORD "GROG"&mdash;ANCIENT ALMS-BASINS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;As a sailor's son I beg to answer your
correspondent LEGOUR'S query concerning the origin of the word
"grog," so famous in the lips of our gallant tars. Jack loves to
give a pet nickname to his favourite officers. The gallant Edward
Vernon (a Westminster man by birth) was not exempted from the
general rule. His gallantry and ardent devotion to his profession
endeared him to the service, and some merry wags of the crew, in an
idle humour, dubbed him "Old Grogham." Whilst in command of the
West Indian station, and at the height of his popularity on account
of his reduction of Porto Bello with six men-of-war only, he
introduced the use of rum and water by the ship's company. When
served out, the new beverage proved most palatable, and speedily
grew into such favour, that it became as popular as the brave
admiral himself, and in honour of him was surnamed by acclamation
"Grog."</p>
<p class="author">MACKENZIE WALCOTT, M.A.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;There are two other alms-basins in St. Margaret's
worthy of note, besides those I mentioned in your last number. One
has the inscription, "Live well, die never; die well and live ever.
A.D. 1644 W.G." The other has the appropriate legend, "Hee that
gives too the poore lends unto thee LORD." A third bears the Tudor
rose in the centre. In an Inventory made about the early part of
the 17th century, are mentioned "one Bason given by Mr. Bridges, of
brasse." (The donor was a butcher in the parish.) "Item, one bason,
given by Mr. Brugg, of brasse." On the second basin are the arms
and crest of the Brewers' Company. Perhaps Mr. Brugg was a member
of it. One Richard Bridges was a churchwarden, A.D. 1630-32.</p>

Knight's Editions of Shakspeare</i>, pp. 115, 116, the following
note occurs:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>King Henry IV., Part Second</i>, act iv. sc. iv.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"As humorous as winter, and as sudden</p>
<p class="i2">As <i>flaws</i> congealed in the spring of day."</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Alluding," says Warburton, "to the opinion of some
philosophers, that the vapours being congealed in air by cold,
(which is most intense towards the morning,) and being afterwards
rarified and let loose by the warmth of the sun, occasion those
sudden and impetuous guests of wind which are called
flaws."&mdash;COLLIER.</p>
<p>"An interpretation altogether wrong, as the epithet here applied
to 'flaws' might alone determine; '<i>congealed</i> gusts of wind'
being nowhere mentioned among the phenomena of nature except in
Baron Munchausen's <i>Travels</i>. Edwards rightly explained
'flaws,' in the present passage, 'small blades of ice.' I have
myself heard the word used to signify both <i>thin cakes of ice</i>
and the <i>bursting of those cakes</i>."&mdash;DYCE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dyce may perhaps have heard the world <i>floe</i> (plural
<i>floes</i>) applied to <i>floating sheet-ice</i>, as it is to be
found so applied extensively in Captain Parry's <i>Journal of his
Second Voyage</i>; but it remains to be shown whether such a term
existed in Shakspeare's time. I think it did not, as after diligent
search I have not met with it; and, if it did, and then had the
same meaning, <i>floating sheet-ice</i>, how would it apply to the
illustration of this passage?</p>
<p>That the uniform meaning of <i>flaws</i> in the poet's time was
<i>sudden gust of wind</i>, and figuratively sudden gusts of
passion, or fitful and impetuous action, is evident from the
following passages:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd</p>
<p>Wreck to the seamen, tempest to the field,</p>
<p>Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</p>
<p><i>Gust</i> and foul <i>flaws</i> to herdsmen and to herds."</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Venus and Adonis.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Like a great sea-mark standing every <i>flaw</i>."</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Coriolanus</i>, act v. sc. iii.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;patch a wall to expel the winter's <i>flaw</i>."</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Hamlet</i>, act v. sc. i.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams</p>
<p>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred <i>flaw</i>."</p>
<p class="i2"><i>3d Pt. Henry VI.</i>, act iii. sc. i.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;these <i>flaws</i> and starts (impostors to true</p>
<p>fear)."</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Macbeth</i>, act iv. sc. iv.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Falling in the <i>flaws</i> of her own youth, hath</p>
<p>blistered her report."</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Meas. for Meas.</i>, act ii. sc. iii.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So far for the poet's acceptation of its meaning.</p>
<p>Thus also Lord Surrey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And toss'd with storms, with <i>flaws</i>, with wind, with
weather."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Beaumont and Fletcher, in <i>The Pilgrim</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"What <i>flaws</i>, and whirles of weather,</p>
<p>Or rather storms, have been aloft these three days."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Shakspeare followed the popular meteorology of his time, as will
appear from the following passage from a little ephemeris then very
frequently reprinted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>De Repentinis Ventis</i>.</p>
<p>"8. Typhon, Plinio, Vortex, aliis Turbo, et vibratus Ecnephias,
de <i>nube gelida</i> (ut dictum est) abruptum aliquid s&aelig;pe
numero secum voluit, ruinamque suam illo pondere aggravat: quem
<i>repentinum flatum</i> &agrave; nube prope terram et mare
depulsum, definuerunt quidam, ubi in gyros rotatur, et proxima (ut
monuimus) verrit, su&aacute;que vi sursum raptat."&mdash;MIZALDUS,
<i>Ephemeridis &AElig;ris Perpetuus: seu Rustica tempestatum
Astrologia</i>, 12&ordm; Lutet. 1584.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have sometimes thought that Shakspeare may have
written:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"As flaws cong<i>est</i>ed in the spring of day."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is an easy thing to have printed cong<i>eal</i>ed for that
word, and <i>congest</i> occurs in <i>A Lover's Complaint</i>.
Still I think change unnecessary.</p>
<p>Has the assertion made in <i>An Answer to Mr. Pope's Preface to
Shakspeare</i>, by a Strolling Player, 1729, respecting the
destruction of the poet's MSS. papers, been ever verified? If that
account is authentic, it will explain the singular dearth of all
autograph remains of one who must have written so much. As the
pamphlet is not common, I transcribe the essential
passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How much it is to be lamented that <i>Two large Chests</i> full
of this GREAT MAN'S <i>loose papers</i> and <i>Manuscripts</i> in
the hands of an ignorant <i>Baker of</i> WARWICK (who married one
of the descendants from Shakspear), were carelessly scattered and
thrown about as Garret Lumber and Litter, to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span> the
particular knowledge of the late <i>Sir William Bishop</i>; till
they were all consum'd in the general Fire and Destruction of that
Town."</p>

<p class="note">[We cannot insert the interesting Query which our
correspondent has forwarded on the subject of the disappearance of
Shakespeare's MSS. without referring to the ingenious suggestion
upon that subject so skilfully brought forward by the Rev. Joseph
Hunter in his <i>New Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and
Writings of Shakspeare</i>, vol. i. p. 105.:&mdash;"That the entire
disappearance of all manuscripts of Shakspeare, so entire that no
writing of his remains except his name, and only one letter ever
addressed to him, is in some way connected with the religious turn
which his posterity took, in whose eyes there would be much to be
lamented in what they must, I fear, have considered a prostitution
of the noble talents which had been given him."]</p>
<hr />
<h3>FOOD OF THE PEOPLE.&mdash;BILLS OF FARE IN 1683&mdash;HUMBLE
PIE.</h3>
<p>The food of the people must always be regarded as an important
element in estimating the degree of civilization of a nation, and
its position in the social scale. Mr. Macaulay, in his masterly
picture of the state of England at the period of the accession of
James II., has not failed to notice this subject as illustrative of
the condition of the working classes of that day. He tells us that
meat, viewed relatively with wages, was "so dear that hundreds of
thousands of families scarcely knew the taste of it.... The great
majority of the nation lived almost entirely on rye, barley, and
oats." (<i>Hist. Eng.</i> vol. i. p. 418., 4th ed.)</p>
<p>It is not uninteresting to inquire (and having found, it is
worth making a note of) what sort of fare appeared on the tables of
the upper and middle classes,&mdash;who, unlike their poorer
neighbours, were in a condition to gratify their gastronomic
preferences in the choice and variety of their viands,&mdash;with
the view of determining whether the extraordinary improvement which
has taken place in the food of the labouring population has been
equally marked in that of the wealthier orders.</p>
<p>Pepys, who was unquestionably a lover of good living, and never
tired of recording his feastings off "brave venison pasty," or
"turkey pye," has given in his <i>Diary</i> many curious notices of
the most approved dishes of his day. The following "Bills of fare"
of the period referred to speak, however, directly to the point;
they are taken from a work entitled, <i>The accomplisht Lady's
Delight, in Preserving, Physick, Beautifying, and Cookery</i>.
London, printed for B. Harris, 1683.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>A Bill of fare for a Gentleman's House about
Candlemas.</i></p>
<p>"1. A Pottage with a Hen. 2. A <i>Chatham</i>-pudding. 3. A
Fricacie of Chickens. 4. A leg of mutton with a Sallet. Garnish
your dishes with Barberries.</p>
<p>"<i>Second Course.</i> 1. A chine of Muton. 2. A chine of Veal.
3. Lark-pye. 4. A couple of Pullets, one larded. Garnished with
orange slices.</p>
<p>"<i>Third Course.</i> 1. A dish of Woodcocks. 2. A couple of
Rabbits. 3. A dish of Asparagus. 4. A Westphalia Gammon.</p>
<p>"<i>Last Course.</i> 1. Two orange tarts, one with herbs. 2. A
Bacon Tart. 3. An apple Tart. 4. A dish of Bon-chriteen pears. 5. A
dish of Pippins. 6. A dish of Pearmains.</p>
<p>"<i>A Banquet for the same Season.</i></p>
<p>"1. A dish of Apricots. 2. A dish of marmalade of Pippins. 3. A
dish of preserved Cherries. 4. A whole red Quince. 5. A dish of
dryed sweet-meats.</p>
<p>"<i>A Bill of Fare upon an extraordinary Occasion.</i></p>
<p>"1. A collar of brawn. 2. A couple of Pullets boyled. 3. A bisk
of Fish. 4. A dish of Carps. 5. A grand boyled Meat. 6. A grand
Sallet. 7. A venison pasty. 8. A roasted Turkey. 9. A fat pig. 10.
A powdered Goose. 11. A haunch of Venison roasted. 12. A
Neats-tongue and Udder roasted. 13. A Westphalia Ham boyled. 14. A
Joll of Salmon. 15. Mince pyes. 16. A Surloyn of roast beef. 17.
Cold baked Meats. 18. A dish of Custards.</p>
<p>"<i>Second Course.</i> 1. Jellies of all sorts. 2. A dish of
Pheasants. 3. A Pike boyled. 4. An oyster pye. 5. A dish of
Plovers. 6. A dish of larks. 7. A Joll of Sturgeon. 8. A couple of
Lobsters. 9. A lamber pye. 10. A couple of Capons. 11. A dish of
Partridges. 12. A fricacy of Fowls. 13. A dish of Wild Ducks. 14. A
dish of cram'd chickens. 15. A dish of stewed oysters. 16. A
Marchpane. 17. A dish of Fruits. 18. An umble pye."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fare suggested for "Fish days" is no less various and
abundant; twelve dishes are enumerated for the first course, and
sixteen for the second. Looking at the character of these viands,
some of which would not discredit the genius of a Soyer or a Mrs.
Glasse, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id=
"page55"></a>{55}</span> it seems pretty evident that in the
article of food the labouring classes have been the greatest
gainers since 1687.</p>
<p>Few things are more suggestive of queries&mdash;as everybody
knows from experience&mdash;than the products of culinary art. I
will not, however, further trespass on space which may be devoted
to a more dignified topic, than by submitting the following.</p>
<p><i>Query.</i>&mdash;Does the phrase "to eat humble pie," used to
signify a forced humiliation, owe its origin to the "umble pye"
specified above?</p>
<p class="author">J.T. HAMMACK</p>
<hr />
<h3>BISHOP BARNABY.</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;Legour asks, why the people in Suffolk call a
lady-bird "Bishop Barnaby?"</p>
<p>I give the following from the late Major Moor's <i>Suffolk
Words</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bishop-Barney. The golden bug. See Barnabee. In Tasser's <i>Ten
Unwelcome Guests in the Dairy</i>, he enumerates 'the Bishop that
burneth' (pp. 142. 144.), in an ambiguous way, which his
commentator does not render at all clear. I never heard of this
calumniated insect being an unwelcome guest in the dairy; but
Bishop-Barney, or Burney, and Barnabee, or Burnabee, and
Bishop-that-burneth, seem, in the absence of explanation to be
nearly related&mdash;in sound at any rate. Under <i>Barnabee</i> it
will be seen that <i>burning</i> has some connection with the
history of this pretty insect."</p>
<p>"Barnabee," writes the Major, "the golden-bug, or lady-bird;
also Bishop-Barney: which see. This pretty little, and very useful
insect, is tenderly regarded by our children. One settling on a
child is always sent away with this sad valediction:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Gowden-bug, gowden-bug, fly away home,</p>
<p>Yar house is bahnt deown and yar children all gone."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To which I add another nursery doggerel less sad:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Bishop, Bishop-Barnabee,</p>
<p>Tell me when your wedding be,</p>
<p>If it be to-morrow day</p>
<p>Take your wings and fly away."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Major adds, "It is sure to fly off on the third
repetition."</p>
<p>"Burnt down," continues the Major, "gives great scope to our
country euphonic twang, altogether inexpressible in type; <i>bahnt
deeyown</i> comes as near to it as my skill in orthography will
allow."</p>
<p>Ray, in his <i>South and East Country Words</i>, has
this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bishop, the little spotted beetle, commonly called the lady-cow
or lady-bird. I have heard this insect in other places called
golden-knop, and doubtless in other countries it hath other names.
(<i>E. W.</i> p. 70) Golden-bugs the common Suffolk name."</p>

<h3>TRADE EDITIONS&mdash;COTTLE'S LIFE OF COLERIDGE.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;In the 2nd vol. of Mr. Collier's valuable and
interesting <i>Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers'
Company</i>, p. 28, is the following entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thos. Dason. Licensed unto him the praise of follie; to print
not above xv&deg; of any impression, with this condition, that any
of the Company may laie on with him, reasonablie at every
impression, as they think good, and that he shall gyve reasonable
knowledge before to them as often as he shall print it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is both curious and important information as being, in all
probability, the earliest recorded instance of a custom still kept
up amongst booksellers, and which now passes under the designation
of a "Trade edition;" the meaning of which being, that the
copyright, instead of being the exclusive property of one person,
is divided into shares and held by several. There are Trade
editions of such voluminous authors as Shakspeare, Gibbon, Hume,
and Robertson, for instance; and Alison's <i>Europe</i>, if
published half a century back, might in all probability have been
added to the list. The difference between the ancient and the
modern usage appears to be this, that formerly when the type was
set up for an edition "any of the company may laie on, (these two
last words are still technically used by printers for supplying
type with paper,) reasonablie at every impression," &amp;c.; in
other words, may print as many copies from the type "as they think
good;" whereas now, the edition is first printed, and then the
allotment of the copies, and the actual cost of them is made,
according to the number of shares.</p>
<p>If this is a "Note" worth registering, it is much at your
service, whilst for a "Query," I should be very glad to be
informed, when a very able review, the date of which I neglected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>{56}</span>
to make at the time, appeared in the <i>Times</i> newspaper, of the
2nd edition of Cottle's <i>Life of Coleridge</i>.</p>
<p>With many good wishes for the success of your register,</p>
<p>I remain, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>DIBDIN'S TYPOGRAPHICAL ANTIQUITIES.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I am very glad to have elicited the information
contained in your number just published respecting the copy of
Borde's work in the Chetham Library. As I have a great respect for
Mr. Ames, I must remark that he had no share in the blunder, and
whenever a new edition of his work is undertaken, it will be well
to look rather curiously into the enlargements of Dibdin. In the
mean time this information naturally leads to another
Query&mdash;or rather, to more than one&mdash;namely, "<i>Had</i>
Mr. Bindley's copy this unique imprint? and what became of it at
the sale of his books? or is it only one of the imaginary editions
which give bibliographers so much trouble?" Perhaps some one of
your correspondents may be able to give information.</p>

<h3>QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 2</h3>
<h3>MADOC THE SON OF OWEN GWYNED.</h3>
<p>The student who confines himself to a single question, may
fairly expect a prompt and precise answer. To ask for general
information on a particular subject, may be a less successful
experiment. Who undertakes extensive research except for an
especial purpose? Who can so far confide in his memory as to append
his name to a list of authorities without seeming to prove his own
superficiality? I throw out these ideas for consideration, just as
they arise; but neither wish to repress the curiosity of
<i>querists</i>, nor to prescribe bounds to the communicative
disposition of <i>respondents</i>.</p>
<p>Did Madoc, son of Owen Gwynedd, prince of Wales, discover
America? Stimulated by the importance of the question, and
accustomed to admire the spirit of maritime enterprise, at whatever
period it may have been called into action, I have sometimes
reflected on this debatable point&mdash;but can neither affirm nor
deny it.</p>
<p>I advise the <i>student</i>, as a preliminary step to the
inquiry, to attempt a collection of all the accessible evidence,
historical and ethnographic, and to place the materials which
pertain to each class in the order of time. The historical evidence
exists, I believe exclusively, in the works of the chroniclers and
bards of Wales; and the ethnographic evidence in the narratives of
travellers in America. The opinions of modern writers, the gifted
author of <i>Madoc</i> not excepted, he is at liberty to consider
as <i>hors-d'oeuere</i>&mdash;to be passed on, or tasted,
<i>&agrave; plaisir</i>. As an exemplification of this plan, I
submit some short extracts, with critical remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Madoc another of Owen Gwyneth his sonnes left the land
[North-Wales] in contention betwixt his brethren, and prepared
certaine ships with men and munition, and sought adventures by
seas, sailing west, and leaving the coast of Ireland so far north,
that he came to a land unknowen, where he saw manie strange
things."&mdash;CARADOC OF LLANCARVAN, <i>continued&mdash;The
historie of Cambria</i>, 1584. 4&ordm;. p. 227.</p>
<p>[The history of Caradoc ends with A.D. 1156. The continuation,
to the year 1270, is ascribed by Powel, the editor of the volume,
to the monks of Conway and Stratflur.]</p>

<p>"This land must needs be some part of that countrie of which the
Spaniardes affirme themselves to be the first finders sith Hannos

Vespatius lead anie Spaniardes thither. Of the viage and returne of

was."&mdash;HUMFREY LHOYD, <i>Additions to the Historie of
Cambria</i>, p. 228.</p>
<p>[Lhoyd, who translated the history of Caradoc, and made
considerable additions to it, died in 1568. He mentions the second
voyage of Madoc, but cites no authority.]</p>
<p>"This Madoc arriving in that westerne countrie, unto the which
he came, in the year 1170, left most of his people there: and
returning backe for more of his owne nation, acquaintance and

etc.&mdash;David Powel, S.T.P., note in <i>The historie of
Cambria</i>, 1584. 4&deg;. p. 229.</p>
<p>[The learned Powel relies on the authority of the poet Gutyn
Owen. "He wrote," says W. Owen, "between A.D. 1460 and
1490"&mdash;three centuries after the event in question!]</p>

<h2>QUERIES</h2>
<h3>"CLOUDS" OR SHROUDS, IN SHAKESPEARE.</h3>
<p>I quite agree with your correspondent D.N.R., that there never
has been an editor of Shakespeare capable of doing him full
justice. I will go farther and say, that there never will be an
editor capable of doing him any thing like justice. I am the most
"modern editor" of Shakespeare, and I am the last to pretend that I
am at all capable of doing him justice: I should be ashamed of
myself if I entertained a notion so ridiculously presumptuous. What
I intended was to do him all the justice in my power, and that I
accomplished, however imperfectly. It struck me that the best mode
of attempting to do him any justice was to take the utmost pains to
restore his text to the state in which he left it; and give me
leave, very humbly, to say that this is the chief recommendation of
the edition I superintended through the press, having collated
every line, syllable, and letter, with every known old copy. For
this purpose I saw, consulted and compared every quarto and every
folio impression in the British Museum, at Oxford, at Cambridge, in
the libraries of the Duke of Devonshire and Lord Ellesmere, and in
several private collections. If my edition have no other merit, I
venture to assert that it has this. It was a work of great labour,
but it was a work also of sincere love. It is my boast, and my only
boast, that I have restored the text of Shakespeare, as nearly as
possible, to the integrity of the old copies.</p>
<p>When your correspondent complains, therefore, that in "Hen. IV.
Part 2," Act III. sc. 1., in the line,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"With deafening clamours in the slippery clouds,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the word <i>shrouds</i> is not substituted by editors of
Shakespeare for "clouds," the answer is, that not a single old copy
warrants the merely fanciful emendation, and that it is not at all
required by the sense of the passage. In the 4to of 1600, and in
the folio of 1623, the word is "clouds;" and he must be a very bold
editor (in my opinion little capable of doing justice to any
author), who would substitute his own imaginary improvement, for
what we have every reason to believe is the genuine text.
<i>Shrouds</i> instead of "clouds" is a merely imaginary
improvement, supported by no authority, and (as, indeed, your
correspondent shows) without the merit of originality. I am for the
text of Shakespeare as he left it, and as we find it in the most
authentic representations of his mind and meaning.</p>

<h3>MEDAL OF THE PRETENDER.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;Possibly some one of your literary correspondents,
who may be versed in the, what D'Israeli would call <i>Secret</i>
History of the Jacobite Court, will endeavour to answer a "Query"
relative to the following rare medal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Obv.</i> A ship of war bearing the French flag; on the shore
a figure in the dress of a Jesuit (supposed to represent Father
Petre) seated astride of a <i>Lobster</i>, holding in his arms the
young Prince of Wales, who has a little windmill on his head.
Legend: "Allons mon Prince, nous sommes en bon chemin." In the
exergue, "Jacc: Fran&ccedil;: Eduard, suppos&eacute;. 20 Juin,
1688."</p>
<p><i>Rev.</i> A shield charged with a windmill, and surmounted by
a Jesuit's bonnet; two rows of Beads or Rosaries, for an order or
collar, within which we read "Honny soit qui <i>non</i> y pense;" a
<i>Lobster</i> is suspended from the collar as a badge. Legend:
"Les Armes et l'Ordre du pretendu Prince de Galles."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difficulty in the above medal is <i>the Lobster</i>, though
doubtless it had an allusion to some topic or scandal of the day;
whoever can elucidate it will render good service to Medallic
History, for hitherto it has baffled all commentators and
collectors of medals. The windmill (indicative of the poplar fable
that the Prince was the son of a miller), and the Roman Catholic
symbols, are well understood.</p>
<p>There is an engraving of this medal in Van Loon's <i>Histoire
Metallique des Pays Bas</i>. It is also imperfectly engraved in
Edwards' <i>Medallic History of England</i>, for the Jesuit is
represented kneeling on the shore, and Pinkerton, who furnished the
text, calls it "a boy kneeling on the shore." The medal is so rare
that probably the artist could obtain only a rubbed or mutilated
impression to engrave from. My description is from a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>{59}</span> specimen, in
my own collection, as fine as the day it was minted.</p>
<p>I may add that both Van Loon and Pinkerton have engraved the
legend in the collar erroneously, "honi soit qui <i>bon</i> y
pense;" it should be "<i>non</i>."</p>
<p class="author">B. NIGHTINGALE.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ROGER DE COVERLEY.</h3>
<p>In the <i>Spectator's</i> description of Sir Roger de Coverley
it is said, "that his great-grandfather was the inventor of that
famous country dance which is called after him." To the tune, as
printed in Chappell's <i>English Melodies</i>, is appended a note
to the effect that it was called after "Roger of Coverley" (Cowley,
near Oxford).</p>
<p>Can any one inform me&mdash;</p>
<p>I. Where any notice of that Roger is to be found?</p>
<p>II. What is the etymon of "Cowley" (Temple Cowley and Church
Cowley)?</p>
<p>III. If any notice of the tune is to be met with earlier than
1695, when it was printed by H. Playford in his <i>Dancing
Master</i>?</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF LANDED AND COMMERCIAL POLICY OF
ENGLAND&mdash;HISTORY OF EDWARD II.</h3>
<p>Who was the author of the two following works?&mdash;"Remarks
upon the History of the Landed and Commercial Policy of England,
from the Invasion of the Romans to the Accession of James I. 2
vols. London: printed for E. Brooke, in Bell Yard, Temple Bar,
MDCCLXXXV."</p>
<p>"The History of the Life, Reign, and Death of Edward II, King of
England and Lord of Ireland, with the Rise and Fall of his great
Favourites, Gaveston and the Spencers. Written by E.F. in the year

<h3>THE REVEREND THOMAS LEMAN.</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;Amongst the later authorities on subjects of
British-Roman antiquity, the Rev. Thomas Leman is constantly
referred to, and in terms of great commendation.</p>
<p>Can you inform me whether that gentleman published any work or
made an avowed communication of any of his researches? His name is
not found in the Index to the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Leman contributed largely to Mr. Hatcher's edition of
<i>Richard of Cirencester</i>; but it is one of the unsatisfactory
circumstances of this work that these contributions, and whatever
may have been derived from the late Bishop of Cloyne, are merely
acknowledged in general terms, and are not distinguished as they
occur.</p>
<p>I believe the MS. of the work was all in Mr. Hatcher's
handwriting; some of your readers may possibly have the means of
knowing in what way he used the materials thus given, or to what
extent they were adapted or annotated by himself.</p>

<h3>GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;Will any of your readers favour me with an account of
the origin, as well as the date of introduction, of the term
"<i>Gothic</i>," as applied to the Pointed Styles of Ecclesiastical
Architecture?</p>
<p>This Query is, of course, intimately connected with the
much-disputed question of the origin of the Pointed Style itself.
But yet I imagine that the <i>application</i> of the term
"<i>Gothic</i>" may be found to be quite distinct, in its origin,
from the first rise of the Pointed Arch. The invention of the
Pointed Arch cannot, surely, be attributed to the <i>Goths</i>;
whence then the origin and the <i>meaning</i> of the term
<i>Gothic</i>?</p>

<h3>KATHERINE PEGG.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I think you may safely add Pepys's <i>Diary</i> to
the list of books in illustration of which you are willing to
receive both Queries and Answers. There is not a passage in the
<i>Diary</i> that does not deserve to be understood.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>{60}</span>
<p>At vol. iv. p. 435. of the new edition is the following
entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"7 May, 1668. Here [at the King's Theatre] I did kiss the pretty
woman newly come, called Pegg, that was Sir Charles Sedley's
mistress, a mighty pretty woman, and seems (but is not)
modest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this Lord Braybrooke has the following note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pegg must have been Margaret Hughes, Prince Rupert's mistress,
who had probably before that time lived with Sir Charles
Sedley."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then follows some account of Mrs. Hughes. But, <i>query</i>,
was the "Pegg" of the <i>Diary</i>, Peg Hughes? was she not rather
as I belived her to have been, Katherine Pegg, by whom king Charles
II. had a son, Charles Fitz-Charles, created Earl of Plymouth, 29th
July, 1675, died 1680?</p>
<p>Katherine Pegg has escaped Lord Braybrooke. Can any of your
correspondents tell me who she was?</p>

<h3>QUERIES IN MEDI&AElig;VAL GEOGRAPHY.</h3>
<p>What are the modern names of "Watewich," "Portum Pusillum,"
"Mare de Saham," "Perpessa," and "Northmuth?" They are not to be
found in Ferrario's <i>Lexicon</i> (a geographical dictionary so
defective that it has not even the Latin name for Aix-la-Chapelle),
nor in Baudrand's <i>Lexicon Geographicum</i> (a good dictionary
for the medi&aelig;val Latin names in France, but not so perfect as
the <i>Index Geographicum</i> attached to the volumes of Bouquet),
nor in Martiniere's <i>Grande Dictionnarie Geographique</i>, nor in
the Index to Wright's <i>Courthand</i>, a miserable and imperfect
compilation.</p>
<p class="note">[These Queries are addressed to our correspondents
in a very flattering review of "NOTES AND QUERIES" which appeared
in the <i>Morning Herald</i> of the 16th of November, and we shall

may be in the power of any of our friends to supply.]</p>

<h3>MYLES BLOOMFYLDE AND WILLIAM BLOMEFIELD'S METRICAL WRITINGS ON
ALCHYMY.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I have had intrusted to me a MS. metrical book on
Alchymy, "written by me Myles Bloomefylde, late of Bury Saynes
Edmunde in ye Countye of Suffolke, Physytione;" but I can find no
account of the author. Worton, Ritson, and Tanner, mention a
"William Blomefield, born at Bury. Bachelor in Physic and a Monk of
Bury," who wrote <i>inter alia</i> a metrical work called
<i>Bloomefield's Blossoms, or the Camp of Philosophy</i>.</p>
<p>Were there two metrical writers on alchymy of the name
Bloomfield, temp. Eliz. and connected with Bury?</p>
<p class="author">BURIENSIS.</p>
<p class="note">[The following Note by Park, which first appeared
in the Edition of Wharton published in 1840, iii., p. 83., coupled
with the fact that William Blomefield is described as a Bachelor of
Physic, would seem to show that there is but one writer, whose
proper name is not William, but Myles: "From Ashmole's <i>Notes on
Theatrum Chemicum</i>, 1652. p. 478., it seems doubtful whether his
name was not Myles."]</p>

<h3>THYNNE'S COLLECTION OF CHANCELLORS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;Can any of your correspondents inform me who

following passage in the <i>Collection of Chancellors of
England</i>, by Francis Thynne, inserted in Holinshed (ed. 1808)
iv. 351.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"John, Chancellor of England in the time of king Henrie the
second, but what he was or in what yeare of king Henrie he lived I
doo not know, and therefore leave it to <i>him that both can and
ought to give life</i> to these persons whom he imprisoneth in the
east castell of London; not doubting but in time he will doo his

<h3>COLD HARBOUR</h3>

Roman Catholic Church&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the number of its members,
or reputed members, in the different European States; the number
and temporalities of its sees, clergy, &amp;c.&mdash;he will confer

<h3>THE CURSE OF SCOTLAND&mdash;WHY IS THE NINE OF DIAMONDS SO
CALLED?</h3>
<p>I shall be obliged to any of your correspondents who will inform
me why the Nine of Diamonds is called the curse of Scotland. I have
heard two causes assigned. One, that the Duke of Cumberland, on the
field after the battle of Culloden, wrote upon the back of this
card a very cruel and inhuman order for the destruction of the
persons and property of the rebels. This cannot be true, for I have
in my possession a print entitled "Britons Association against the
Pope's Bulls." In it the young Pretender or prince is represented
attempting to lead across the Tweed a herd of bulls laden with
curses, excommunications, indulgences, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. On
the ground before them lies the Nine of Diamonds. This print is
dated Oct. 21. 1745, some months previous to the battle of
Culloden.</p>
<p>The other cause assigned is, that the nine lozenges with which
the saltire is charged in the armorial bearings of the Earl of
Stair, are so arranged as to resemble the nine of diamonds, which
was called the curse of Scotland, from the active part taken by
that Earl in promoting the Union, which was most unpopular in
Scotland. I cannot positively deny that the card in question owes
its evil name to this cause, but I am not aware that the Earl of
Stair was so conspicuously active as to occasion his being
peculiarly selected as an object of popular aversion on that
account. He was indeed a commissioner for drawing up the articles
of the union, and he was sent ambassador to the court of Louis XIV.
chiefly for the purpose of watching the proceedings of the
Jacobites; these circumstances may have added to the odium which
attached to his name from the part which was taken by his
predecessor, who was Secretary for Scotland, and was charged with
having exceeded his authority in ordering the massacre of
Glencoe.</p>
<p class="author">EDW. HAWKINS.</p>
<p>Nov. 12. 1849</p>
<p class="note">[We would add to Mr. Hawkins's Query, another,
viz.: What is the earliest known instance of the card in question
being so designated? For it is clear, if such was the case before
the Union, the second explanation is as little satisfactory as the
first.]</p>

<h3>NOTES OF BOOK SALES&mdash;CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>The collectors of British portraits&mdash;and there are
doubtless many such among our readers&mdash;will shortly have such
an opportunity of enriching their portfolios as rarely presents
itself. Messrs. Sotheby and Co. commence, on the 3rd of December,
the sale of the second portion of the important and valuable stock
of prints belonging to the well-known and eminent printsellers,
Messrs. W. and G. Smith, whose shop in Lisle Street, Leicester
Square, has been for so many years the favourite resort of all who
were in search of the rare and curious in calcographic art. Messrs.
Sotheby describe the present Sale as "comprising one of the most
numerous and interesting collections of British Historical
Portraits ever offered for sale;" and the following Lots, which
exhibit specimens of the rarities it contains, justify their
statement.</p>

<p>We have also received:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Catalogue of English and Foreign Theology, including some of
the rarest works of our early English Divines; nearly a complete
series of the Fathers of the Church; the various Councils and most
important Ecclesiastical Historians, Liturgical writers, &amp;c."
issued by Leslie, of 58. Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn, which
is one which will greatly interest all readers of the peculiar
class to whom it is more particularly addressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same may be said of the excellent "Catalogue of Old and New
Books (Part CIV)," just delivered by Petheramm of 94. High Holborn:
which, in addition to theological works, exhibits many valuable
productions in historical and general literature.</p>
<p>Bernard Quarritch's "Catalogue of Foreign Books and Classics,
selling at 16. Castle Street, Leicester Square," well deserves the
attention of philologists. It is rich, not only in works
illustrative of the Oriental languages and literature, but also in
those of Germany and Scandinavia. Indeed, it is one which should be
looked into by all students of foreign literature.</p>
<p>Some curious articles, more especially in early Italian and
French literature, and on the subject of Alchymy, Astrology, Magic,
&amp;c., will be found in a "Catalogue of Interesting and Rare
Books on sale, by George Bumstead, No. 205. High Holborn."</p>
<p>William Nield, 46. Burlington Arcade is, we believe a new
candidate for the favours of the purchasers of old books. His first
Catalogue contains some curious Articles in the departments of
Demonology and Witchcraft; a few varieties belonging to the
"Marprelate" class such as "Penri's Exhortation;" and a fine
collection of Classical Music.</p>
<p>Lastly, let us mention what cannot but interest many reader of
"NOTES AND QUERIES," that Mr. Lumley, of 56. Chancery Lane, having
purchased the stock of Society of Antiquaries' publications has
divided the volumes of the Arch&aelig;logia, and has just put forth
a Catalogue of the separate papers, which are for sale, and of
which he says very truly, "their value cannot be disputed," and
they are "now for the first time offered thus to the Public."</p>

<h3>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>
<p><i>The matter is so generally understood with regard to the
management of periodical works, that it is hardly necessary for the
Editor to say that</i> HE CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO RETURN MANUSCRIPTS;
<i>but on one point he wishes to offer a few words of explanation
to his correspondents in general, and particularly to those who do
not enable him to communicate with them except in print. They will
see, on a very little reflection, that it is plainly his interest
to take all he can get, and make the most, and the best of
everything; and therefore he begs them to take for granted that
their communications are received, and appreciated, even if the
succeeding Number bears no proof of it. He is convinced that the
want of specific acknowledgment will only be felt by those who have
no idea of the labour and difficulty attendant on the hurried
management of such a work, and of the impossibility of sometimes
giving an explanation when there really is one which would quite
satisfy the writer, for the delay or non-insertion of his
communication. Correspondents in such cases have no reason, and if
they understood an editor's position they would feel that they have
no right, to consider themselves undervalued; but nothing short of
personal experience in editorship would explain to them the
perplexities and evil consequences arising from an opposite
course</i>.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Surely</i> MELANION <i>is too hard upon our correspondents
and too</i> exigeant <i>towards ourselves. He would place us in a
singular position. He should consider that we have not opened lists
for all comers to tilt against each other. We invite</i>
litterateurs <i>to a</i> re-union, <i>in which they may give and
receive mutual help and aid; but, in order to do so, they must
tolerate each others' little peculiarities, and not espy offence in
them</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
